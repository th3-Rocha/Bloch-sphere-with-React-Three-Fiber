# Bloch Sphere with React Three Fiber

This project implements an interactive visualization of the Bloch sphere from quantum mechanics using React Three Fiber.

The Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of the state space of a two-level quantum mechanical system such as a qubit. Points on the surface of the sphere correspond to pure states, while the interior points correspond to mixed states.

This implementation allows the user to:

- **Drag** to rotate the sphere and view from any angle
- **Click** to move the pointer representing the qubit state
- **Visualize** how the quantum state changes

## Features

- Rendering of Bloch sphere and pointer using **Three.js**
- React components for sphere, pointer and controls  
- **Drag and click** interactivity to adjust state
- Fully customizable styling

## Built with

- **React**
- **React Three Fiber**
- **Three.js**

Overall, this project provides a reusable React component to add an interactive Bloch sphere visualization to any web-based quantum education or research application.
